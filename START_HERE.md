  ```bash
  make install-peft               # Just PEFT notebooks
  make install-instruction-tuning # Just instruction tuning
  make install-all                # Everything
  ```

### ✅ Docker Support

- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** (dev/prod)
- **GPU support** with NVIDIA Docker
- **Docker Compose** for easy orchestration
- **Zero configuration** for users

### ✅ VS Code Dev Containers

- **One-click setup** in VS Code
- **Pre-configured** Python, Jupyter extensions
- **Consistent** development environment

### ✅ Developer Experience

- **Makefile** with simple commands (`make help`)
- **Scripts** for common tasks (`./scripts/setup-dev.sh`)
- **Pre-commit hooks** for code quality
- **CI/CD ready** with GitHub Actions example

### ✅ Comprehensive Documentation

- **README per section** with best practices
- **Setup guides** for all methods
- **Architecture docs** explaining design
- **Contributing guidelines** for new contributors
