# ü§ù Contributing to LLM Finetuning Cookbook

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## üìã Ways to Contribute

- üêõ Report bugs
- üí° Suggest new fine-tuning recipes
- üìù Improve documentation
- üîß Fix issues
- ‚ú® Add new notebooks

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LLM-Finetuning-Cookbook.git
cd LLM-Finetuning-Cookbook
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install all dependencies including dev tools
make setup-dev

# Or manually:
poetry install --with full-finetuning,peft,instruction-tuning,reasoning,dev
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

## üìù Adding a New Notebook

### Structure

Each notebook should follow this structure:

```python
# Cell 1: Title and Description
"""
# [Technique Name] - [Model Name]

**Description**: Brief explanation of what this notebook does.

**Key Concepts**:
- Concept 1
- Concept 2
- Concept 3

**Dependencies**: List specific dependencies needed
"""

# Cell 2: Install Dependencies (if needed)
# !pip install specific-package==version

# Cell 3: Imports
import torch
from transformers import ...
# ... other imports

# Cell 4-N: Implementation with detailed comments
# ... your code with explanations
```

### Checklist for New Notebooks

- [ ] Clear markdown cells explaining each step
- [ ] Well-commented code
- [ ] Example output/results
- [ ] Works with specified dependencies
- [ ] No hardcoded paths (use `./data`, `./models`, etc.)
- [ ] GPU memory requirements documented
- [ ] Expected training time documented
- [ ] Links to relevant papers/resources

### Adding Dependencies

If your notebook needs new dependencies:

1. **Identify the appropriate group** (or create a new one)
2. **Add to `pyproject.toml`**:

```toml
[tool.poetry.group.your-new-group]
optional = true

[tool.poetry.group.your-new-group.dependencies]
new-package = "^1.0.0"
```

3. **Update the Makefile** with an install target:

```makefile
install-your-new-group: ## Install dependencies for Your New Group
	poetry install --with your-new-group
```

4. **Update SETUP.md** with the new group information

## üß™ Code Quality Standards

### Python Code

We use:

- **Black** for formatting (line length: 100)
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking (where applicable)

```bash
# Format your code
make format

# Check linting
make lint
```

### Notebook Guidelines

- **Clean outputs** before committing (pre-commit hook does this automatically)
- **Keep cells small** and focused
- **Use markdown liberally** to explain concepts
- **Include visualizations** where helpful
- **Test on a small dataset** first (if applicable)

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
feat: add RLHF fine-tuning notebook
fix: correct learning rate in GPT-2 notebook
docs: update setup instructions for Windows
style: format code with black
refactor: reorganize PEFT examples
test: add validation for summarization
```

## üîç Testing Your Changes

### Test Locally

```bash
# Test notebook runs without errors
poetry run jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute your-notebook.ipynb

# Or open in Jupyter and run all cells
make jupyter
```

### Test Docker Build

```bash
# Ensure Docker image builds successfully
make docker-build

# Test running in Docker
make docker-up
# Check http://localhost:8888
```

## üì§ Submitting Changes

### 1. Ensure Quality

```bash
# Run all checks
make format
make lint
make clean
```
